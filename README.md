# LTA Smart Agent

## Development

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and install required libraries from `requirements.txt`.

If that is not working, run the following command to install the essential libraries from Pip.

```
pip install pandas numpy langchain langchain-experimental python-dotenv tabulate boto3 sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```
